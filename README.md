JSFUrlFilter
============

JSFUrlFilter is a framework to provide friendly URLs for JSF 2.0 web applications. It allows mapping of simple URLs like '/home' to lengthy JSF URLs like '/mylanding/myhome.xhtml'.

You will need to add JSF 2.0 library files (JSF 2.0 Mojarra 2.0.3-FCS was used here).

Pending Updates:<br/>
Loggers needs to be added appropriately in code.
